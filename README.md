Description
With given numbers, the programm must display a sorted stack with the lowest number of operations.


Instructions
In order to run program, follow this instructions : 
1. make re
2. ./push_swap [given numbers]
Warning : In the given numbers, not alphabet is allowed or any arguments not being integers, or the integer limits or duplicates.


Resources
I have read many articles about algorithm in order to choose.
I used many git for understand how to manipulate stacks.
I turned to IA for some minors issues and more understand severly part of algorithm.
To the begin at the end, I collaborated to my peers.


Technical choices
In first place, I choosen turc algorithm but I couldn't get it to run over the number 455.
On peer recommandation, I used the butterfly algorithm.
Because, it was more effeciently for sorting stack.
